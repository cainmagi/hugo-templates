      <description>The message of God’s heart for all nations (ethne = people groups) is a central theme of the Bible, where God desires every Christian to be involved in some way in bringing the Gospel to unreached people groups, wherever Christians and unreached people may be. It is to God’s glory that people from every tribe, nation, and tongue worship Him! Global missions is a universal Christian responsibility that cannot be ignored.</description>

      <description>Community Groups Community groups are open to people across various life stages. The vision is to foster gospel community among members who live, work, and play in a similar geographic community.
We believe a mix of singles, couples, and families (including kids) all in the same group will naturally encourage discipleship between older and younger believers. And if we&amp;rsquo;re all neighbors, then we can more easily and effectively reach our neighbors and serve our community together.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
