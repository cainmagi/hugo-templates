# Women’s Ministry

## Spring Cleaning for the Heart and Soul
    
-----

* SAT, April 13
* 1:30 pm – 3:30 pm
* HCC Chapel

Spring time means Spring Cleaning, but it can go far beyond the nooks and crannies of our homes. Join us as we explore what it means to declutter our hearts and refresh our souls. We will also have a time of fellowship and soap-crafting. For more information, please email [hccgals@gmail.com](mailto:hccgals@gmail.com).

### Women's Ministry

The vision of the Women’s Ministry at HCC is: To support, encourage, and train the women of Houston Chinese Church for the glory of God.

We strive to do this by providing intergenerational opportunities for women to gather to study the Bible, fellowship, and participate in community service. When women of different generations study and fellowship together, there are opportunities to forge meaningful relationships outside of our peer groups.

We currently have three annual events:

* **Spring gathering** – one day event where we meet for worship, devotional, discussion, and craft/project.
* **Summer bible study** – a weekly study where participants work through daily lessons for Bible study during the week, then meet once a week for small group discussion and teaching on the same topic.
* **Fall gathering** – one day event where we meet for worship, devotional, discussion, and craft/project.
For more information, email [hccgals@gmail.com](mailto:hccgals@gmail.com).

### Mothers of Little Ones

* **Vision**: We seek to support mothers through friendship, mentorship, and sharing God’s love and the gospel message as we intentionally build relationships with those in the neighboring community.
* **Meetings**: 1st and 3rd Wednesdays of every month from 9:30-11:30am, with occasional social outings (about once a month).
