## Nursery ministry

The Nursery ministry is for infants and toddlers age 0-3 years old. We provide a warm and welcoming environment where we hope children are drawn to learn about God and encouraged to pursue Him. Even young toddlers can learn that Jesus loves them. Our classes include 30 minutes of songs and stories centered on Christ. For more information about our ministry, please view our Nursery Brochure.

We’d love to hear from you at [nursery@hcchome.org][nur-email].
