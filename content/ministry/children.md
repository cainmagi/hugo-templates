## Children's Ministry

Our passion at HCC is to connect kids and their families to God and others. We do this through worship, teaching, caring, serving, and outreach, striving to lay a spiritual foundation in their lives that will lead them to a personal relationship with Jesus Christ in God’s perfect timing. We also desire to provide them with a safe and nurturing environment where their faith can grow and blossom. The Children’s Ministry seeks to support, supplement, and partner with families as they train their children in God’s ways.

### Sunday Morning Services

Kids' Church is held during the first Sunday service (9:15 AM – 10:45 AM). Worship, games and small group are  incorporated into lessons on discipleship.

#### Sunday School

Sunday School during the second Sunday service (11:00 AM – 12:15 PM) focuses on giving kids a big picture view of God’s story by going through the Bible in one year. Every Sunday begins with worship time before moving to age-appropriate classes from toddlers through 5th grade. Through small classes, teachers are able to connect with the kids and establish a year-long relationship with them. Third graders and up are dismissed on their own at 12:15 PM. Second graders and below must be picked up by parents.

#### Choir

**Choir** meets from 12:45 – 1:25 PM. There are three different children's choirs: Preschool choir, 1st-2nd grade choir, and 3rd-5th grade choir. For more information, contact [Tim Lai](mailto:timl@hcchome.org), the worship director.

#### AWANA on Friday Nights (Sept–May)

{{< figure class="center" src="https://hcchome.org/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/03/image_awana-acronym.jpg" title="Awana acronym" >}}

**AWANA** is a Friday evening program for 4 year olds through 5th grade that focuses on learning God’s Word in a fun atmosphere. AWANA uses Game Time, Handbook Time, and Council Time to encourage children to memorize God’s Word and understand it. Theme nights, Store and special events (e.g., Grand Prix) make this both exciting and educational.
