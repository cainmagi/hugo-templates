English Buddy is an outreach ministry of HCC. We seek to share God’s love and gospel message with internationals by being English conversation partners.

* The primary way we outreach is by building relationships with the internationals through hanging out over meals/coffee/sports, emailing, being an American resource for them if have any questions about the US or Houston.
* Secondarily, we have two main events a year – Christmas Party and Easter Picnic. Many times, the internationals only come if they already know someone at the party, so it’s nice if they already have a relationship with you.

In summary, you only need two things to be in English Buddy:

1. You can speak English, and
2. You are willing to step out of your comfort zone and share God and your life with an unchurched international.

In the process, you might even make a a few new friends! For more information contact [hccenglishbuddy@gmail.com](mailto:hccenglishbuddy@gmail.com).
