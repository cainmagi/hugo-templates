## Our Core Values

All of our ministries at Houston Chinese Church are shaped by these twelve core values. By God's grace, we seek to live out these values personally and corporately for His glory and the good of His church.

### Christ's Headship

We acknowledge Christ as the head of our church. (Col 1:17-18)

### Biblically Faithful

We strive to teach God's Word with integrity and authority to help individuals find Christ and live as his disciples. (Col 1:28; 2 Tim 3:16-17)

### Authentic Worship

We desire to acknowledge God's supremacy in our personal lives and in the corporate, contemporary and blended worship of our church. (Jn 4:23-24)

### Grace Oriented

We focus on God's free acceptance and full forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ. We strive to motivate people through love and thankfulness to God without an undue emphasis on guilt, shame and duty. (1 Jn 4:7ff)

### Dignity of People

We seek to treat each person as God's image bearer, so that every person who comes into our community will feel respected and treated with dignity. (Gen 1:26-27)

### Culturally and Seeker Sensitive

We try to adapt our ministry of the Gospel to the diverse background of people that God brings to us. (1 Cor 9:19-23)

### Relational Focus

We emphasize healthy relationships among Christians. We will focus on fellowship and small groups as the primary means of caring for each other, developing friendships, and sharing of our lives. (1 Jn 1:7)

### Family Affirming

We strive to strengthen the families in our church community. We want to support and encourage the children, youth and single adults among us. (Eph 5:21-33)

### Mobilized Church Community

We desire to see every person in our church actively using the spiritual gifts that God has given them. (Eph 4:11ff)

### An Evangelistic Lifestyle

We deliberately encourage our people to share the Gospel message to those around us through our lifestyle as salt and light and through using intentional evangelistic tools and methods. (2 Tim 4:2)

### A Heart for Missions

We strive to continue to broaden our worldview by praying for and bringing the gospel message to other parts of the world. (Mt 28:18ff)

### A Holistic Ministry

We seek to serve the spiritual and physical needs of the community in which we are located. (Lk 4:18)
