## Cornerstone Christian Fellowship (CCF)

Cornerstone Christian Fellowship is our collegiate fellowship that ministers to undergraduate students. **We meet in co-ed small groups on Friday evenings in various locations on the Rice University campus.** Meetings involve a shared meal, a dedicated time to study scripture, good conversation, and plenty of prayer.

If you would like more information about CCF or would like to visit a small group, email [ccf@hcchome.org](mailto:ccf@hcchome.org) or join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/146225062133286/).
