## Community Groups

Community groups are open to people across various life stages. **The vision is to foster *gospel community* among members who live, work, and play in a similar *geographic community*.**

We believe a mix of singles, couples, and families (including kids) all in the same group will naturally encourage discipleship between older and younger believers. And if we're all neighbors, then we can more easily and effectively reach our neighbors and serve our community together.

If you would like more information or would like to visit a community group, please email [smallgroups@hcchome.org](mailto:smallgroups@hcchome.org).
