## Family Groups

Our family groups provide a great context for building relationships and learning with and from each other. **The frequency and format vary among groups, but we all share a commitment to mutually caring for each other.** Groups that meet on Friday evenings at HCC offer opportunities for your kids through AWANA (children) and inSpire (teens).

If you are interested in visiting a group, please email [smallgroups@hcchome.org](mailto:smallgroups@hcchome.org) expressing your interest along with a description of your life-stage and the age of your children (if applicable). We'll get back to you and recommend a group to visit.
