### Sermon description

Jesus gives us the privilege of serving him. However, if we do not pace ourselves, we can surely burn out. Therefore, it is imperative to set aside time to recharge and rest so that we can charge again. Ministry is a marathon and not a sprint. May we be available as we step out in faith to serve the Lord.
