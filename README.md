# Hugo Templates

## Introduction

This is a collection of hugo templates extended by Yuchen Jin (cainmagi). Check the sub-branches to see the templates and their demos. Since they are adapted from other templates, we may apply different licenses to different templates. If anyone who want to use these templates, please pay attension to the licenses.

Note that these demos require us to install [Hugo][hugo]. And we recommend [typora][typora] for users who need to work with MarkDown files.

Currently this collection includes:
