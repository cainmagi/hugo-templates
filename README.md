# Hugo Templates

## Introduction

This is a collection of hugo templates extended by Yuchen Jin (cainmagi). Check the sub-branches to see the templates and their demos. Since they are adapted from other templates, we may apply different licenses to different templates. If anyone who want to use these templates, please pay attension to the licenses.
